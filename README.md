# Shararth's README
 
I am aware of readme for a project but this is the first time i heard about readme of a person. I was introduced to this concept by my Brother && Guide && Mentor && Manager. I hope this is an opportunity for you to know about me in workplace and in general. 

### Me in Workplace
* Equally comfortable working as a member of a team and independently
* Quick learner
* Adaptable 
* Always find a way to make things happen
* If i am stuck at something, can't concentrate on other things until it is done
* Hate being micromanaged
* Shy in the beginning
* Honest; don't afraid to say "I Don't Know"
* procrastinate sometimes
* Like listening to music while work 

### Feedback
* Always ready to hear from you and improve myself
* Prefer personal feedback
